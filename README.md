# Cancer Classification, Churn Prediction, and Customer Segmentation

This repository contains several Jupyter Notebooks and datasets focused on different machine learning tasks. The main purpose of these files is to serve as learning resources for understanding various machine learning techniques, including classification, regression, and clustering.

## Files in the Repository

1. **Cancer_Classification_using_SVM.ipynb**: 
   - This notebook demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for cancer classification. It covers preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

2. **ChurnData.csv**: 
   - A dataset containing customer churn data, used for predicting customer churn using machine learning models.

3. **Class_Logistic_Regression.ipynb**:
   - This notebook focuses on using Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks. It provides a detailed example of preprocessing data and building a Logistic Regression model.

4. **Clus_K_Means_Customer_Seg.ipynb**:
   - This notebook demonstrates the K-Means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation. It walks through the process of clustering customers based on their features to identify different segments.
